            June 8, 1977
            Kanye Omari West is born in Douglasville, Georgia by the proud parents Donda Williams and Ray West.

            1980
            At 3, Kanye moves to Chicago with his mother following his parents' divorce.

            1990
            Kanye’s mother, Donda West, helps a then 13-year-old Kanye pay to cut his first record in a basement studio. 
            "The microphone was hanging from the ceiling by a wire hanger. 
            But he was so excited, I couldn’t say no," Donda West would tell RedEye in 2007. 
            Years later, No I.D. would hear the song, called “Green Eggs and Ham,” and in an interview with Billboard, described it as a “90s-sounding, yelling-type record."

            1994
            Graduates from Polaris High School. 
            West receives a scholarship to attend Chicago’s American Academy of Art and studied painting before transferring to Chicago State University to major in English literature.

            August 1996
            At 19, Ye pops up at the Fat Beats storefront in Greenwich Village and delivers a freestyle that has since become a great time-capsule for the next generation.

            1998
            Kanye's first big break arrives. 
            He sells his first beat to local Chicago rapper Gravity for $8,000. 
            He next sold a beat for $5,000 to Jermaine Dupri for his debut album, Life in 1472. Months after Dupri's LP release, he landed a track on Ma$e's Harlem World group album The Movement. 
            Not before long, he drops out of Chicago State University to pursue his music dream.
            After the placements, Columbia Records eventually dangles a record contract. However, things fell through. "I said, I'm going to be bigger than Michael Jackson, I'm going to bigger to Jermaine Dupri.
            I said that to (Columbia executive) Michael Mauldin," Kanye would later reveal in an interview. Mauldin happened to be Dupri's father. 
            By the end of the meeting, as Kanye noted, "they hit me with those three words: we'll call you. They sent limos on the way up, and when I got downstairs I couldn’t even catch a cab."


            "NOTHING IN 
              LIFE IS 
             PROMISED
            EXCEPT DEATH"
