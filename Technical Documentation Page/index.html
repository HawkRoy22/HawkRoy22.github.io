            <h1>What's HTML</h1>
            <pre>
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                HTML consists of a series of elements
                HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

                All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: &lt;!DOCTYPE html>.

                The HTML document itself begins with &lt;html> and ends with &lt;/html>.

                The visible part of the HTML document is between &lt;body> and &lt;/body>.

                The &lt;!DOCTYPE> Declaration
                The &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

                It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

                The &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

                The &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

                HTML Headings
                HTML headings are defined with the &lt;h1> to &lt;h6> tags.

                &lt;h1> defines the most important heading. &lt;h6> defines the least important heading:

                <h3>What is CSS?</h3>

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
                With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

                Using CSS
                CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

                Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
                Internal - by using a &lt;style> element in the &lt;head> section
                External - by using a &lt;link> element to link to an external CSS file
                The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
